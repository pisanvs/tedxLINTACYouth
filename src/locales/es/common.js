  aboutTheme1: "(ESPAÃ‘OL) The theme for <RedText>TEDxLINTAC <b>Youth</b></RedText>, <i>\"All Limits; Beyond Limits,\" &nbsp;</i> invites <b>exploration of the boundaries we face</b> in various aspects of life and how we can transcend them. Whether they're physical, mental, societal, or technological, limits shape our perception of the world, challenging us to adapt, innovate, and grow. By examining these limits, we not only recognize the constraints that define our experiences but also discover the opportunities they present. <b>Our goal is to enable powerful conversations about what it means to face limits</b> whether as obstacles, motivators, or even catalysts of creativity. We deeply believe that pushing beyond these boundaries is what our community needs.",
  aboutTheme2: "Through this theme, we aim to cultivate a sense of curiosity and inspiration. This year, <RedText>TEDxLINTAC <b>Youth</b></RedText> is about sharing ideas that encourage us to rethink the possible, exploring stories of resilience, innovation, and imagination."
